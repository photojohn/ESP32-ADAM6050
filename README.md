This code should be able for ESP32 to act like a ADAM-6050 I/O module with Synology Surveilance Station using WiFi for communications. I've tested it only with Az-Delivery ESP32-WROOM-32 board.

Change WiFi credentials before use by editing `secrets.h`.

GPIO pins 36, 39, 34 and 35 do not have pull-up resistors on my ESP32 board, so external pull-up resistors should be used.
I organised pins in order that was easier for me to solder jumper wires, so output pins might seem out of order.

!!!WARNINGS!!!
* This code does not implement password validation and session management and should not be used in external networks.
* ESP32 supports only 3.3V I/O logic and external logic level converter should be used to work with higher voltage logic
